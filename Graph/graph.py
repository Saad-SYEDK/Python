# Similar to Trees, Graphs are also a non-linear data structure.
# They consist of a finite set of vertices (or nodes) and a set of edges that connect pairs of vertices. 
# Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they can also be weighted or unweighted.
# Graphs are used to represent various real-world problems, such as social networks, transportation networks, and computer networks.

# Graphs can be represented using an adjacency list(using linked list) or an adjacency matrix[2d array].
# In an adjacency list, each vertex has a list of its adjacent vertices.
    # It is a more space-efficient representation for sparse graphs, where the number of edges is much less than the square of the number of vertices.
    
    
# In an adjacency matrix, a 2D array is used to represent the connections between vertices, where the value at row i and column j indicates whether there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j.
    # It is a more space-efficient representation for dense graphs, where the number of edges is close to the square of the number of vertices.
